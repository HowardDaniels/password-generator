# password-generator

This application is designed to provide users with a strong, randomly generated password. 

Users are first prompted to select how long their password can be (the password may be between 8 and 128 characters inclusive).

If users select a password length that is out of range, users are prompted to enter a password with the proper length (this prompt reappears until the user selects a password length within range).

Users are then asked to confirm the following:

* that they want special characters in their password
* that they want numbers in their password
* that they want both upper- and lowercase letters in their password (if users say no to this, they are asked if they want all letters to be lowercase, or the alternative - uppercase).

After confirming the above, the user's password is ready to be generated and copied, as confirmed in an alert message.

Upon clicking the button "Generated Password", the password appears in the box, and upon clicking the button "Copy to Clipboard", this password is copied to the user's clipboard.

The application is responsive at the max widths of 980px, 768px, and 640px.
